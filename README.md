# Social and Economic Determinants of Birth Rates in 2023: A Cross-Country Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the data, code, and supporting materials for the study **“Social and Economic Determinants of Birth Rates in 2023: A Cross-Country Analysis.”**  
The project investigates whether social (demographic and health-related) or economic factors better explain cross-country differences in birth rates during the post-pandemic year 2023.

Using cross-sectional data from 65 countries and a log-linear Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, the study finds that **demographic structure and mortality conditions dominate economic indicators** in explaining fertility variation.

## Research Objectives
The main objectives of this study are to:
- Quantify the relative importance of **social determinants** (maternal age, age dependency ratio, child mortality, crude death rate) versus **economic determinants** (GDP per capita, government revenue, government expenditure).
- Examine whether short-term economic conditions in 2023 exert independent effects on fertility after controlling for demographic structures.
- Provide empirical evidence relevant to the post-COVID-19 adjustment period.

## Key Findings
- Fertility differences in 2023 are primarily driven by **demographic and mortality-related factors**.
- Higher age dependency ratios are associated with higher birth rates.
- Delayed maternal age and higher mortality rates are linked to lower fertility.
- Economic indicators such as GDP per capita and fiscal variables show **no independent effect** once social factors are controlled.
- Policy responses to fertility decline should prioritise **long-term demographic and health interventions** rather than short-term fiscal expansion.
